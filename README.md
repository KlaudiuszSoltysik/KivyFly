# KivyFly
## Video demonstration where I'm describing project (sound on):

## Features:
User wishlist is uploaded or deleted from Google spreadsheet straight from the code using request library and API. Internet connection is obligatory.
I used an API algorithm. It checks the price of flights matching your preferences in the next 180 days using an API to download data.
You can set up a cloud to run api_request.py automatically every day.
Program will update you in case of finding matching flights. If there are multiple flights you will receive 3 cheapest ones dayly.
For SMS messages I had to sign up to Twilio site.

To make this app even better, I could add a function to save files locally and update a cloud spreadsheet when running this program next time with an internet connection.
I could let user define who is going to flight (adult or kid) and many more filters.
Also, more code comments and visuals of this project may be improved.
